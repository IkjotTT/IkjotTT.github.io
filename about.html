          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there, I am Ikjot Titrie!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a firm believer in living life with an open heart and being a risk-taker. Whether, this leads to trying
            new things, meeting new people, or embarking on trips without knowing where you are headed.
            I am always ready to have a good time.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, having fun is not all that I am about. I am all about seeking and seizing new opportunities when they
            arrive. I am constantly working on a new project, learning a new skill, or seeking a new opportunity in
            employment to further my experience.
            I am always up for a challenge!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am an active user of social media. I love to scroll through posts and mainly use social media as a way to
            stay connected with everyone.
            Currently, I am on Facebook and Instagram. Reach Out to Me!
          </p>

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to my professional and academic endeavors, I find immense joy in exploring a wide range of
            interests in the form of hobbies I have taken up.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find trying to learn new things such as coding languages, technology, or changes that have occured in the
            world. I keep up to date with the latest news and find passion and interest in learning about the
            changing stock market and how it works. Additionally, I love travelling and find interest in victorian-era
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have an interest in interior design. I often spend time renovating and creating different designs and
            floorplans for houses.
            I have also worked and created backyards and basements while also furnishing and painting rooms.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hob-cont col-lg-6">
          <p>
            I also like to enjoy video games in my free time. I find video games to be very interesting and a great way
            to pass time. My favorite game would be Elden Ring and love playing it from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy going on long walks and exploring everything around me. I sometimes go one or two hours away
            from my city to enjoy the landscape of the country. I particularly enjoy hiking trails and reconnecting with
            nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I enjoy watching and playing sports. I find basketball and soccer to be very intriguing, I both
            watch and play
            these sports during the summer. My favorite
            players are Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, and Cristiano Ronaldo.
            I find these players to be incredibly entertaining to watch and like them for their especially hard-working
            traits which I personally take inspiration from.

          <!-- Text about your education -->
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a proud fourth-year student at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I am enrolled in the
            Business Technology Management program pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (BComm). Since enrolling, I have
            undertaken plenty of different opportunities and courses
            through my journey. Through the rigorus coursework and plentiful hands-on projects, I have been able to hone
            my skils and gain a deep understanding of business and IT integration. Beyond the classroom, I intend to
            continue furthering my knowledge by pursuing internships, networking events, and workshops. I have also been
            successful in being included into the Dean's list on three separate occassions (2020-21, 2021-22, 2023-24).
          </p>
          <p>
            As I progress through my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to graduate by 2025. I intend to leverge
            my education, skills, and projects to pursue a career as a data analyst post-graduation. I am intrigued by
            the world of data
            and have accumulated plenty of knowledge on the workings of programs such as SQL and Python. I am eager to
            apply my expertise to help organizations excel and look forward to contributing to society. I am confident
            that I will be able to tackle the challenges I face in the changing landscape of the business world.
